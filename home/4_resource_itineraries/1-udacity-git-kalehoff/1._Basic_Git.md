# 1. Basic Git
Created Thursday 05 November 2020

#### About the section

* It covers all the Git basics.
* These are *more* than enough for daily tracking(notes, medium level projects).
* These are enough for online collaboration.


#### Time to learn

* Took me ~2 full days, note that I was new to version control and was preparing the notes.
* Can be skimmed in 6 hours.

Note: Avoid using external tools like ``grep`` for this section. Try to work with git commands only. Of course, this is just for the learning phase.
