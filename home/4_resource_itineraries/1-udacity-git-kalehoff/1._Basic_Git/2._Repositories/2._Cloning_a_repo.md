# 2. Cloning a repo
Created Friday 06 November 2020

What is cloning - creating an identical copy.
Why do it - for contributing to an existing repo on your PC, or for generating scaffold from a template repo etc.


* Explicitly nested repos are not allowed in Git. Git does have a 'submodules' features though.
* If a repo is stored inside another, then it is ignored by the outer repository.


*****


* git clone needs a path of the original repo, which is mostly a URL

* git clone creates a new folder, with name same as the original repo
* To clone a repo but with a different name, just provide the desired name as a second argument(path is the first arg).

* Before doing git clone, cd into the correct location.
* Once git clone is complete, cd into into the repo(directory) to start working.
