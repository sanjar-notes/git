# 1. Creating a repo
Created Friday 06 November 2020

Three important commands:

* git ``init`` - makes the current directory a repository.
* git ``clone`` - copying a repo to local storage from somewhere else, e.g a URL
* git ``status`` - shows the status of Git, when run inside the working directory

Note: 

* ``git init`` can create a new folder too, if repo_name is provided as argument. This way you can skip a ``mkdir`` and ``cd``.
* Running ``git init`` more than once causes no harm.


*****

Running ``git init`` creates a hidden ``.git`` directory. This ``.git`` directory is the brain/storage centre for the repository. It holds all of the configuration files and directories and is where all of the commits are stored.

*****


#### ``.git`` directory contents

* ``config`` file - stores all repo specific info like username, email, etc. This can be used if non-global Git variables are to be used.
* ``description`` file - used by GitWeb program, ignorable
* ``hooks`` directory - we can place scripts here, which interact with Git's lifecycle events
* ``info`` directory - contains the 'exclude' file - the files which Git shall ignore 
* ``objects`` directory - all commits are stored here
* ``refs`` directory - holds pointer to commits(i.e branches and tags)

Note: Except the hooks directory, nothing should be changed manually. It can mess up the repo.
