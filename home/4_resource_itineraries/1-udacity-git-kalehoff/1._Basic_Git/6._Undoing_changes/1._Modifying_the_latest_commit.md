# 1. Modifying the latest commit
Created Monday 09 November 2020

**Why modify a commit**
-----------------------
Consider these situations:

1. You made a typo in the commit message.
2. You forgot to include(i.e stage) some important files before committing.


* And we certainly don't want an extra commit, for two reasons: The old commit is invalid and it's messy to keep unnecessary.

These situations make the case for an 'amend commit' feature.
And Git has one.

Modifying the latest commit
---------------------------

* ``git commit --amend`` lets us edit the last commit. We can edit:
	1. The message
	2. Files
* **Steps** for editing the last commit(assuming working directory is clean):
	1. Edit, save, stage the files.
	2. Run ``git commit --amend``
	3. Change the message if needed

Done!

* Remember, when ``--amend`` is used, the staging area automatically becomes populated, so we don't have to add all the files again. Only add the required files 
* If we have to remove file(s), it is better to do ``git reset --soft HEAD ^ && git rm --cached file1 file2 && git commit -m message``. ``--amend`` will not work here.
