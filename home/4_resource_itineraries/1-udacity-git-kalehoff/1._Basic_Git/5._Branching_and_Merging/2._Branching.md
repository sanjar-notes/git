# 2. Branching
Created Saturday 07 November 2020

Jargon:

* MASTER - the default branch, created by git
* HEAD - a pointer variable used by the repo. By default, it points to the latest commit on the current branch.
* Every branch's HEAD pointer actually points to the latest commit in that branch. __Redundant__

#### More about HEAD(optional)

* Purpose of HEAD - act as bookmark/state of the repo.
* When you switch to a branch, HEAD points to the latest commit in that branch.


*Skip this* if learning Git for the first time.

* HEAD can be made to point to a older commit. The repo is now said to have a "detached-HEAD".
* Moving(or pointing) the HEAD to a commit has no effect on the repo or files, because it's just a pointer variable.
* HEAD is relevant only to the repo area. It is irrelevant to the staging area and working directory.

Think of HEAD as the *slider* in a progess bar. By default, it points to the end. Moving it doesn't affect the video.

**Commands**

* Create a branch

	git branch new_branch_name # creates branch from latest commit of the current branch
	git branch new_branch_name SHA_ID # creates branch from the given commit of the current branch
	git branch new_branch source_branch


Note: Git doesn't switch automatically to the new branch. However, there is a shortcut to do so.

* Switch to a branch

	git checkout destination_branch_name # HEAD now points to destination_branch_name
	

* List all branches

	git branch # show a list of all branches

Note: The branch is marked with an asterisk(*).


* Delete a branch

	git branch -D branch_name # deletes the branch and brings us to the MASTER, if we are on the deletend
	

* Shorctut to create and switch to the new branch - in one command

	git checkout -b new_branch_name
	

*****


* It's important to understand how 'checkout' works. Running the command will:
	* Replace all files and directories from current Working Directory that Git is tracking

*(files that Git tracks are stored in the repository, so nothing is actually lost)

* Go into the repository and pull out all of the files and directories of the commit that the branch points to
* Because we can do one thing at a time, it makes sense to just show information about the current branch. All commands show only branch relevant info.


* When we make a new branch, all the previous commits(i.e before the starting commit of the new branch) are also available to us. This is why we see parallel lines going back in the diagram.

Red is the main branch here. Lines show reachability.

* git checkout is not like the cd command, it needs an argument at all times.


*****


* using git log displays only the commits of the current branch(which includes commit before the start commit of the parent branch)
* git log has an option called **--graph**. This shows the branches in a graphical way.
* **--all** option which displays all commits of the repo, in all branches. It is non-redundant, i.e multiple branches starting from a parent branch don't show the old commits again.
