* There are 4 lines in all for each commit:
	* SHA - commit ID
	* author
	* date
	* message
* Order of listing commits is 'recent first'

	commit 5de135ab4ca51b7d86b53ea1f81bca100c6eeb40 #SHA

* 'git log' can does take an argument. It will display the given commit and its predecessors.

Note:

* the output can be shortened using the --oneline option. Because only the SHA(6-8 chars) and the message is important, in most cases.git

* git log uses a pager to display the commits, the colon indicates that some text is remaining. Navigate using the arrow keys. Press q to quit the pager.
