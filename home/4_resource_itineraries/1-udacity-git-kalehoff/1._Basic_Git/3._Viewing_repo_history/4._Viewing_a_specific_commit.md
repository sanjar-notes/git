# 4. Viewing a specific commit
Created Saturday 07 November 2020

Until now, if we needed info on a specific commit, we did this:

1. Scroll - impractical
2. grep - not good because number of lines are unknown. Also the coloring is lost.


None of this is a good idea. To solve this problem, git has another command.

git show
--------

* **git show** takes a SHA_id of commit as its argument. It displays information only about the specified commit.

	git show fdf5493


* By default, --patch is enabled.
* It supports the --stat, -w options.
