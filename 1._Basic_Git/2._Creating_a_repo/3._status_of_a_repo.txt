====== 3. status of a repo ======
Created Friday 06 November 2020

**How do we know what Git has done, or if it is ready for more commands?**
Using the 'git status' command. 'git status' is our key to the mind of Git.
* 'git status' is like 'ls', we can use it to see if something has changed in the directory.
--------------------
* running 'git status' tells us many things. Some important ones are:
	1. the branch we are on
	2. whether it is up to date with 'origin/master', i.e shows the changes w.r.t the original repo
	3. Shows if there's something to add(to the staging area) or if things are to be committed.
