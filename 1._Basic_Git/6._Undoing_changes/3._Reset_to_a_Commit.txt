====== 3. Reset to a Commit ======
Created Monday 09 November 2020

* Reset means to get rid of some work and start again.
* Resetting is different from reverting. It actually //erases //all successive commits.

* If a commit is not in the repo, its content is gone.
* When we reset to a commit, all successive commits are trashed.

===== 'git reset' Command =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
git reset SHA_id #SHA_id becomes the starting point
}}}
	
When a commit is reset, its data can to be transferred to three regions, determined by three options:
* --soft - No change in worktree and indexw
* --mixed - Only index is reset.
* --hard - Both worktree and index are reset.

MAID - keep in mind that WD is safe except in --hard.
The default option for reset is --mixed. You'll lose the WD.
