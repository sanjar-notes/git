# 2. Reverting a Commit
Created Monday 09 November 2020


* Revert means to undo a change. i.e if something was removed, add it and vice-versa.
* Git does exactly this with the given commit. It creates a new commit, which reverts everything that was done in the commit. You've got to provide a message.
* Command is

	git revert SHA_id_commit_to_be_reverted



* Git revert works for any previous commit, even if it is between other commits.
* The successive commits are not changed.
