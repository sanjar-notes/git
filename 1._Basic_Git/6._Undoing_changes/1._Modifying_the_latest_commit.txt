====== 1. Modifying the latest commit ======
Created Monday 09 November 2020

===== **Why modify a commit** =====
Consider these situations:
1. You made a typo in the commit message.
2. You forgot to include(i.e stage) some important files before committing.
* And we certainly don't want an extra commit, for two reasons: The old commit is invalid and it's messy to keep unnecessary.
These situations make the case for an 'amend commit' feature.
And Git has one.

===== Modifying the latest commit =====
* ''git commit --amend'' lets us edit the last commit. We can edit:
	a. The message
	b. Files
* **Steps** for editing the last commit(assuming working directory is clean):
	1. Edit, save, stage the files.
	2. Run ''git commit --amend''
	3. Change the message if needed
	Done!
* Remember, when ''--amend'' is used, the staging area automatically becomes populated, so we don't have to add all the files again. Only add the required files 
* If we have to remove file(s), it is better to do ''git reset --soft HEAD ^ && git rm --cached file1 file2 && git commit -m message''. ''--amend'' will not work here.
