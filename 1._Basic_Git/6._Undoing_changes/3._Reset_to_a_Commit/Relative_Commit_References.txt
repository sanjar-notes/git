====== Relative Commit References ======
Created Monday 09 November 2020

===== Relative Commit References =====
We have seen that commits can be referenced using SHA, tags, branches and HEAD. But sometimes, we'll want to reference a commit w.r.t another commit. e.g the commit before the last, or 2nd before the last.

This is achieved using some special characters called 'Ancestry References':
* ^ - indicates parent of commit. No args taken.
* ~n - indicates nth parent of commit. Takes n as arg, default arg is 1.

e.g
	Parent of the current(latest) commit
	* HEAD^
	* HEAD~
	* HEAD~1
	Grandparent of the current(latest) commit
	* HEAD^^
	* HEAD~2
	Great-grandparent of the current(latest) commit
	* HEAD^^^
	* HEAD~3
* What's the difference between ^ and ~, except that one is repetitive?
	* With a merge commit, the ^ reference is used for first parent, while ^2 indicates the second parent(which was the merger). ~ has no such meaning, it is just for the ancestry level.
* HEAD~0 is the same as just HEAD.
* More examples:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
