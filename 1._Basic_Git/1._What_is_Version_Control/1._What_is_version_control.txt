====== 1. What is version control ======
Created Thursday 05 November 2020

Version control is similar to taking snapshots of a chessboard if the match is paused. If anything happens to the board, it can be recreated.

* Remember that the goal of a version control system is to help you maintain a detailed history of the project as well as the ability to work on different versions of it. Having a detailed history of a project is important because it lets you see the progress of the project over time.
* If needed, you can also jump back to any point in the project to recover data or files.
--------------------
Some popular VCS(Version Control System):
1. Git
2. Subversion
3. Mercurial
--------------------
There are two types of version control systems:
1. Centralized model - All code is kept on a central computer. All interaction must go through this central computer.

2. Distributed model - All coders have a copy of the entire project, including previous history. This has an advantage that work can be done offline.

* Git is a DVCS
--------------------
Git and GitHub are two very different things
* Git is a tool used for achieving version control
* GitHub is an online service which hosts(keeps) Git projects. Think of it as a separate computer where we can store Git projects.
* Git does **not** store deltas, unlike other VCSs.

Note: GitHub is not necessary for using Git.
