====== 4. Viewing a specific commit ======
Created Saturday 07 November 2020

Until now, if we needed info on a specific commit, we did this:
1. Scroll - impractical
2. grep - not good because number of lines are unknown. Also the coloring is lost.

None of this is a good idea. To solve this problem, git has another command.

===== git show =====
* **git show** takes a SHA_id of commit as its argument. It displays information only about the specified commit.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
git show fdf5493
}}}

* By default, --patch is enabled.
* It supports the --stat, -w options.
