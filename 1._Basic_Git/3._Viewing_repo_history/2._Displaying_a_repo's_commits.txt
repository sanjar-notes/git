====== 2. Displaying a repo's commits ======
Created Saturday 07 November 2020

* 'git log' is used to display all commits of a repo.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
git log # shows all commits
}}}

* There are 4 lines in all for each commit:
	* SHA - commit ID
	* author
	* date
	* message
* Order of listing commits is 'recent first'
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
commit 5de135ab4ca51b7d86b53ea1f81bca100c6eeb40 #SHA
Author: Richard Kalehoff <richardkalehoff@gmail.com> #Author
Date:   Sat Dec 3 15:42:07 2016 -0500 #Date

    Set article timestamp color #message
}}}

* 'git log' can does take an argument. It will display the given commit and its predecessors.
Note:
* the output can be shortened using the --oneline option. Because only the SHA(6-8 chars) and the message is important, in most cases.git
	{{./pasted_image.png?width=400}}
* git log uses a pager to display the commits, the colon indicates that some text is remaining. Navigate using the arrow keys. Press q to quit the pager.
