Commits are like a Daily diary(aka journal) of a person.
A good diary has these:
1. Short heading for the event
2. Date of the event
3. Content of the event
* Git uses exactly the same parameters
* Date, content  and username are captured automatically by Git, only the heading(or message in Git) is needed from the user.

--------------------
A diary is useful only if these things are kept in mind:
1. Entries must be made often - how often, just look at major codebases.
2. A single journal entry should describe a single major event.
--------------------
How do we review a Repo's history?
Using two commands:
1. **git log** - Displays information about all the existing commits.
2. **git show** - Displays information about a specific commit. Takes commit SHA number as argument.
