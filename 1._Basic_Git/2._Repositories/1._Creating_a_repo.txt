====== 1. Creating a repo ======
Created Friday 06 November 2020

Three commands:
* git init - makes the current directory a repository.
* git clone - copying a repo to local storage from somewhere else, e.g a URL
* git status - shows the status of Git, when run inside the working directory

Note: 
* git init can create a new folder too, if repo_name is provided as argument. This way can skip doing **mkdir** and **cd** into a new folder.
* Running git init more than once causes no harm.
--------------------
Running 'git init' creates a hidden .git directory. This .git directory is the brain/storage centre for the repository. It holds all of the configuration files and directories and is where all of the commits are stored.
--------------------
.git directory contents

* ''config'' file - stores all repo specific info like username, email, etc. This can be used if non-global Git variables are to be used.
* ''description'' file - used by GitWeb program, ignorable
* ''hooks'' directory - we can place scripts here, which interact with Git's lifecycle events
* ''info'' directory - contains the 'exclude' file - the files which Git shall ignore 
* ''objects'' directory - all commits are stored here
* ''refs'' directory - holds pointer to commits(i.e branches and tags)
Note: Except the hooks directory, nothing should be changed manually. It can mess up the repo.
