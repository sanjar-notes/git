====== 1. Tagging ======
Created Saturday 07 November 2020

* Suppose we do a major commit. To come back to this commit, we'd have to filter through all messages. Having a special indicator could help.
* Tagging in Git means to add something other than the message to a commit. This helps us single out major commits.

	Our major commit is accessible more easily.
* Tagging is just an extra summary associated with a commit.
--------------------
**Commands**
* Add a tag to the latest commit
	Just after committing. Use the git tag command.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
git commit -m "blah blah"
git tag -a text_without_quotes #applies to the latest commit
git tag -a text_without_quotes -m "tag message"
}}}
	
* Add tag to a specific commit - git tag also takes SHA as an argument
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
git tag -a tag_text SHA_ID -m "message"
}}}
	
* To view all tags
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
git tag # shows only tags, without SHA
}}}
	
* Delete tag from a commit
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
git tag -d tag_text # this deletes any tag, not just the latest one
git tag --delete tag_text # the same
}}}
	
Note:
	* Doing git log or git show, will show the tag besides the SHA
	* If -a is not used, the tag is said to be lightweight. -a tags can store date, author and a message. -a is short for annotate
	* To replace a tag, you must delete the current tag.
