====== 3. git diff ======
Created Saturday 07 November 2020

* Cmparing files between [[1. git add|areas]] of a repo.
* Areas - files can be grouped by area:
	* Repository(commit)
	* Staging Area
	* Working directory(i.e modified files that haven't been staged).

=== Syntax ===
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
git diff area1 area2
}}}

* By default, diff compares untracked and tracked files
* Display changes between current commit and unstaged files, that have been modified.
* Tracks soft changes.
This is done using the 'git diff' command.
* --stat and -p, both are available here.
