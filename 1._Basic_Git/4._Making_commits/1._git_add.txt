====== 1. git add ======
Created Saturday 07 November 2020

* If we do git status after creating some files. Git says the new files are untracked.

* Making a commit requires the files to be 'staged' first. The **''git add''** command is used to move files from the Working Directory to the Staging Index.
* Git has 3 areas at any point in time: the working directory(what you can see), the staging area(or index) and the repository.

===== git add =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
git add index.html #staging the file
}}}


Result

* The 'changes to be committed' refers to the files which have been staged but not committed.
* Unstage file(s) - '**git rm --cached filename**" command. Nothing changes in the working directory.

**Notes:**
* git add can take multiple files as argument.
* To avoid verbosity, just do **git add .** to stage all files. A better option is 'git add -A', because it works even if you're not in the root directory.
* Staging is required for each commit, even if the same files were committed previously; the staging area is cleared after each commit.
* Any changes(edit, rename, delete) made to a file don't affect its copy in the staging area.
