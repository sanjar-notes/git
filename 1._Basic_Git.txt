====== 1. Basic Git ======
Created Thursday 05 November 2020

=== About the section ===
* It covers all the Git basics.
* These are //more// than enough for daily tracking(notes, medium level projects).
* These are enough for online collaboration.

=== Time to learn ===
* Took me ~2 full days, note that I was new to version control and was preparing the notes.
* Can be skimmed in 6 hours.
Note: Avoid using external tools like ''grep'' for this section. Try to work with git commands only. Of course, this is just for the learning phase.
