====== 4. Nested Submodules ======
Created Sunday 21 February 2021

* This is very simple.
* The root repo only keeps a configuration file for each submodule, even those that are submodules of another submodule. The actionable consequence is that we need to make a commit in root repo ''commit'' every time we change the state of any submode however nested, because the ''.gitmodule'' file changes for each parent submodule.
* Each repo(including the root repo), tracks only the submodules that were added directly to it.
* Each submodule B, is supposed to keep its submodule C's VC data in its own ''.git/module'', and the same applies for the parent of B, which is say A. Consequently(recursivelyüòÉÔ∏è), all the ''.git'' contents are stored in the ''.git/module'' the root repo, in their respective hierarchies of course. **This still does not mean that the root repo keeps track of nested repos.**
